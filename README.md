# My First Git Project

This repository contains a simple HTML boilerplate created as part of an introductory project to learn the basics of Git and version control.  

repo: https://github.com/luizjuninho/gittest.git

## Project Overview

The project includes a minimal HTML5 structure with the fundamental elements:

- **DOCTYPE** declaration to define the document as HTML5.  
- **Head section** containing metadata such as character encoding, viewport settings, and a title tag.  
- **Body section** organized with semantic elements:  
  - `<nav>` for navigation,  
  - `<header>` for the page header,  
  - `<main>` for the main content area, and  
  - `<footer>` for footer information.  

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to understand the structure of a basic HTML page and to practice using Git commands such as:
- Initializing a repository  
- Adding and committing changes  
- Creating and pushing branches
